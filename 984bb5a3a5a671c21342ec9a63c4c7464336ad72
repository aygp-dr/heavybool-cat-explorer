Implementation notes for HeavyBool 0.1.0:

Thought process:
- Started with fixing basic path issues and module imports
- Implemented missing heavybool-monad.scm with proper Writer monad structure
- Created comprehensive strange-loops.scm demonstrating self-referential patterns
- Built complete test suite covering all functionality
- Added robust error handling throughout the codebase
- Verified all category theory examples work correctly

Debugging/Issues encountered:
- Initial path loading issues with relative imports from different directories
- SRFI-9 record type not imported, causing syntax-transformer errors
- Counterexample extraction was complex due to nested forall-m structure
- Function composition syntax needed adjustment for Guile compatibility
- Test expectations needed adjustment for annotation list structure

Cleanup performed:
- Fixed all import paths and module loading
- Added comprehensive documentation and prerequisites
- Implemented proper error handling with type checking
- Created working Makefile targets for examples and tests
- Ensured all 54 tests pass successfully
- Verified category theory code blocks work correctly

Technical decisions:
- Used SRFI-9 records for type safety and performance
- Implemented proper Writer monad with bind, return, fmap operations
- Added Kleisli composition for category theory demonstrations
- Used annotate functions for reason tracking
- Implemented quantifiers as natural transformations
- Created self-referential examples showcasing strange loops

Future improvements:
- Could add more sophisticated counterexample extraction
- Performance optimizations for large data sets
- Additional category theory examples (limits, colimits)
- Integration with other Scheme DSP systems
- Documentation generation from code comments
