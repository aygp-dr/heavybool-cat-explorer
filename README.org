* HeavyBool: Reflective Boolean Values with Category Theory

This project implements Jim Newton's HeavyBool concept from ELS'25 in Guile Scheme, with a focus on the category theoretical foundations.

** Overview

HeavyBool extends boolean values with explanatory metadata, allowing:
- Tracking of reasoning in boolean operations
- Detection of witnesses and counterexamples in quantifiers
- Self-referential structures connecting to Hofstadter's strange loops

** Unique Features

- *Writer Monad Structure*: HeavyBool as a practical example of the Writer monad
- *Natural Transformations*: Quantifiers as natural transformations
- *Kleisli Category*: Composition of HeavyBool operations
- *Strange Loops*: Self-referential structures in the style of Hofstadter

** Prerequisites

- GNU Guile 2.2+ (tested with 2.2.7)
- Make (for running build targets)

** Getting Started

1. Install Guile: =apt install guile-2.2= (Debian/Ubuntu) or =brew install guile= (macOS)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run examples: =make run-examples=
4. Run tests: =make test=
5. Explore category theory: See =category-theory.org=
6. Understand strange loops: See =examples/strange-loops.scm=
