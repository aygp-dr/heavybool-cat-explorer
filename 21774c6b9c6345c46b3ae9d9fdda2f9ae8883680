Context:
This commit establishes a comprehensive Scheme development environment for the HeavyBool Category Explorer project, integrating modern tooling for interactive development and exploration of the HeavyBool algebraic system.

Considerations:
- Chose Guile 3 as the primary Scheme implementation for its mature ecosystem and excellent Geiser integration
- Emacs configuration is self-contained and can be loaded with -Q flag to avoid user config conflicts
- Tmux session management provides persistent development environment with TTY tracking for remote debugging
- Paredit ensures structural editing safety when working with S-expressions
- Org mode integration enables literate programming approaches for documenting mathematical concepts

Technical Decisions:
- PROJECT_NAME and PROJECT_ROOT are configurable via environment or Makefile variables
- Emacs config auto-installs required packages from MELPA if not present
- Geiser load paths automatically include src/, examples/, and tests/ directories
- Company mode provides context-aware completions for Scheme symbols
- Rainbow delimiters improve nested parenthesis visibility in complex expressions

Issues Addressed:
- Need for consistent development environment across team members
- Requirement for interactive REPL-driven development with hot code reloading
- Support for both local and remote development via TRAMP
- Integration with existing project structure and test framework

Timing:
- Implementation: ~10 minutes
- Testing verified tmux session creation and Emacs/Geiser startup
- Configuration follows Emacs Lisp best practices and Scheme community conventions

Future Enhancements:
- Consider adding support for other Scheme implementations (Racket, Chicken)
- Could integrate with LSP for additional code intelligence features
- Potential for custom Geiser extensions specific to HeavyBool operations
